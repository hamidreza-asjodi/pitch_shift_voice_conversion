# pitch_shift_voice_conversion
Voice conversion algorithm using librosa pitch shift in a realtime structure.
Pitch shift is one of the easiest and convient way of deidentification and conversion of speech. This is a process to altering the fundamental frequency of input speech and fundamental frequency corresponds to the rate at which the vocal folds vibrate during speech production.
| input speech | reduction of pitch(3 semitone)    | increase of pitch(3 semitone)    |

Here in a real-time process, we change the pitch of the input speech in the short segments and play them in default device of your system.
